; The 'ROM' diagnostic test performs a checksum of the ROM.
; It loops over each byte in the ROM in 256 byte blocks, adding the value of
; each byte to a total checksum byte. This checksum is expected to add up, with
; integer overflow, to '0'. This byte placed here is the final remainder byte
; that will cause the ROM  checksum to total to '0'.
; To calculate this value for the ROM, set this value to '0', build the ROM,
; then run the associated script to generate the remainder byte.
; Refer to the external documentation for the tools used to calculate this.
